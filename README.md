# Math For DSA

It is a very useful topic for solving problems of computer science and also has vast applications in competitive programming. Some of them are mentioned below:

1. Problem-Solving: It is mostly used in solving complex mathematical ideas in mathematics and computer science.

2. Competitive Programming: Algorithms like Sieve of Eratosthenes, Euclid algorithm, Binary exponentiation are some of the most common topics used in competitive programming.

3. Recurrence relation: A lot of problems in DSA require the usage of recursion. Using the knowledge of mathematics several recurrence relations can be turned into mathematical formulae which makes solving the problem quite an easy task.

4. Heavy calculation: Problems containing complex mathematical concepts and heavy calculations are easily done in comparatively less time using these algorithms instead of manual calculations.

5. Statistics: Mathematical algorithms are also important for data processing, i.e., for converting raw data into useful information and also for analyzing them.
