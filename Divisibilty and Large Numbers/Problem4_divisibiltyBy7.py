'''
Naive approach: A simple method is repeated subtraction. 
Following is another interesting method.
Divisibility by 7 can be checked by a recursive method. 
A number of the form 10a + b is divisible by 7 if and only if 
a â€“ 2b is divisible by 7. In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits.
Continue to do this until a small number.

#Naive Approach - Repeated Subtraction

    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
    
#recursive approach

    # if number becomes - negative in recursive case make it positive
    if n < 0:

    #base case
